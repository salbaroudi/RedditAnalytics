### Introduction:

140k+ acronyms were mined from science, tech, bio and future leaning subreddits. This was done with PRAW and compiled into a .csv file.  This data set was originally mined to be a learning tool, used to illustrate pandas groupings, visualizations and count based time series. If the data set is refined enough, it might be possible to use it for prediction.

### Data Acquisition (Codebook):

PRAW (a python3 library) was used to mine the data from a list of subreddits that were hand selected. Science and Tech themed subreddits were focused on, as they tend to have higher quality content. To expand the list, [a subreddit graph explorer][graphexplore] was used to get a better view of the Sci/Tech subreddit network. Subreddits were excluded according to the following criteria: 

(1) Too few submissions and/or users. 

(2) Too esoteric, niche, or a subset of a much larger subreddit (example: pennystocks is a subset of stocks, in terms of content scope). 

(3) Satirical, politicized, or highly valenced in content (example: pcmasterrace). 

Some of these points are dependent on human interpretation - which may introduce bias into the data. See *subreddit.txt* file for a list of those selected. For each subreddit: upto 1000 submissions had there comment trees fully populated, and each comment was scanned for acronyms that were 3 to 7 letters in length. Associated information was then compiled, and written to a csv file. The format of the data table is below:


**commID:** Reddit Comment ID *(base 36 integer) (primary key)*

**time:** unix system time stamp for comment, that acronym is mentioned in. *(float)*

**user:** username for person making comment. *(string)*

**subreddit:** name of subreddit acronym appears in. *(string)*

**acronym:** The term itself. *(string)*
